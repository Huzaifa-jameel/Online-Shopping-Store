# Online Shopping Store

A comprehensive Frontend e-commerce application designed to simulate a real-world shopping experience. This project focuses on managing complex UI states, handling product data dynamically, and ensuring a seamless user interface across various devices.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project is structured to separate concerns, making the codebase scalable and easy to maintain:

* **Logic Layer (JavaScript):** Handles the shopping cart state, price calculations, and DOM manipulation.
* **Presentation Layer (HTML/CSS):** A custom-styled interface built without heavy external frameworks to demonstrate core CSS proficiency.
* **Data Simulation:** Products are managed via JavaScript objects/arrays, simulating how data would be received from a REST API.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 1. State Management & Shopping Cart Logic
The heart of the application is the cart system. Key technical challenges solved include:
* **Unique ID Validation:** Ensuring that adding an existing item to the cart increments the quantity rather than creating a duplicate entry.
* **Real-time Totals:** Implementing functions that listen for changes in the cart to recalculate the subtotal, taxes, and final price instantly.

### 2. Local Storage Persistence
To prevent data loss on page refresh, I implemented the **Web Storage API**. The cart state is serialized into JSON and stored in the user's browser, then parsed back into the application state upon reloading.

### 3. Responsive Grid System
Instead of relying on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, I utilized **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** to create a fluid product gallery. This ensures the shopping experience is consistent on:
* Mobile devices (Single column layout)
* Tablets (Two-column layout)
* Desktops (Four-column layout)

### 4. Event Delegation
For performance optimization, I utilized event delegation to handle "Add to Cart" and "Remove" actions. This reduces the number of event listeners in the DOM, keeping the application fast and responsive.

## 🚀 Key Functionalities

* **Dynamic Product Rendering:** Products are injected into the DOM dynamically, allowing for easy updates to the inventory list.
* **Cart Drawer/Overlay:** A sliding cart interface that allows users to review their selection without leaving the current page.
* **Quantity Control:** Users can adjust item counts directly within the cart view.
* **Empty State Handling:** The UI intelligently updates to show when the cart is empty, encouraging further browsing.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup for SEO and accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Custom variables (CSS roots) for consistent branding and advanced animations for UI transitions.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Utilized Arrow functions, Template Literals, and Array Methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) for clean, modern code.
